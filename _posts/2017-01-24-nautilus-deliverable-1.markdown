> Founded in 1986, Nautilus, Inc. is a consumer fitness products company headquartered in Vancouver, Washington. Nautilus is committed to providing innovative, quality solutions to help people achieve their fitness goals through a fit and healthy lifestyle. Its products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Nautilus®, Bowflex®, Octane Fitness®, Schwinn® and Universal®. Nautilus market its products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which it considers to be separate business segments. Its Direct business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising, catalogs and the Internet. Its Retail business offers products through a network of independent companies to reach consumers in both the home use as well as commercial use markets in the United States and internationally. It also derives a portion of Its revenue from the licensing of its brands and intellectual property.

## Industry
The Gym and Exercise Equipment Manufacturing industry produces a variety of equipment, including treadmills, exercise bikes and weights. Even as industry revenue risen in certain years over the period, the trend toward industry globalization has threatened the future growth. As with many manufacturing industries, offshoring has become popular in this industry over the past decades due to lower production costs. Major companies in this industry have either enlisted foreign third party manufacturers or moved their own operations overseas. As a result, in 2016, imports are expected to make up 62.4% of domestic demand. Gym, Health and Fitness Clubs industry is expected to rise by an average annual rate of 2.6%, allowing gym owners to purchase higher volumes of quality industry products. 

## Competitors and Market Share 
Nautilus (1% market share) main competitor include Fitness Quest, ICON Health & Fitness, Johnson Health Tech, Beach Body (2%), American Telecast, Life Fitness (10%), and Precor (4%). It also competes with marketers of computer-based physical activity products, such as the Nintendo Wii® and Microsoft Xbox® Kinect®, and weight management companies, such as Weight Watchers, each of which offers alternative solutions for a fit and healthy lifestyle.

## Macroeconomic Factors
Gym and exercise equipment are discretionary goods. As a result, as per capita disposable income rises, so does demand for the products this industry manufactures. In addition, gyms and fitness clubs are main buyers of the industry and their orders has an impact and the industry. Moreover, imports also satisfy a large portion of domestic demand for industry products. Therefore, the relative changes in the exchange rates and foreign trade policy significantly affect imports' competitiveness in the US market. Lastly, trends in sports participation influence demand for different types of gym and exercise equipment. While an overall rise in the number of consumers participating in sports bodes well for this industry, demand is also affected by changing consumer preferences among different types of sports. 

## Competitive Advantage
It is unclear at this point in our analysis what the competitive analysis for Nautilus is. It is clear from the language in financial reports that the company heavily relies on its brands as a differentiator, it’s unclear whether this is a true competitive advantage.

## Risk Factors
Firstly, the barrier of entry in the industry is low and Nautilus lacks significant competitive advantage. Its patent protection is not strong enough to deter competition and the technology and manufacturing knowhow can be easily accessible through third-party manufacturers. Secondly, a successful product launch will bring several years of growth to the business, but keeping up with the changing preference of consumers is tricky. The raising trend of community-based and cause-based exercise is also dragging people away from fitness machines, a trend difficult to adapt to for the business. Thirdly, the rise of fitness clubs may have a negative effect on Nautilus market share and margin. As more and more people prefer to workout in these fitness clubs, Nautilus will be forced to sell more to them. However, these buyers have stronger purchasing power and thus reduce the profit margin of the Company. 

In conclusion, the main advantage of the brand is its brand and reputation, and its future growth is susceptible to trends. From the language used in the 10-k, it seems the management is not prepared for these challenges.

## Vertical and Horizontal Statement Analysis
Visible throughout all financial statements is the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2013 from losses in previous years. Worth noting in the vertical balance sheet analysis is the decrease in cash on hand from past years to 2015; which could be explained by decreasing need for a cash buffer during the post-financial disaster recovery and through the acquisition of Octane Fitness (which also shows up in an increase in “goodwill” & “other intangible assets” accounts). Furthermore, we note the creation of a large “Note payable, non-current, net of amortized debt issuance” account reflecting Nautilus issuance of bonds during 2015. 

Via vertical income statement analysis, we see that Nautilus has shown a trend toward limiting the growth of “operating expenses” and fixed costs over time. The “general and administrative” account has decreased as a percentage since 2010 while the “sales and marketing” account shrunk in 2010 – 2011 and has stayed steady as a percentage since. Likewise, “cost of sales” has decreased as a percent of “net sales” since 2010, a healthy trend. 
The horizontal balance sheet simply shows another view of the large tax benefit in 2013, as well as the issuance of bonds and the acquisition of Octane Fitness in 2015. 

We once again see a healthy percentage increase of “Net Sales” at a faster pace than “cost of sales” on the horizontal income statement. However, “cost of sales” did grow at a higher rate (though still lower than net sales) in 2014 and 2015 – which could be explained by a 2013 launch in new cardio equipment. The last account worth noting is the Income from “continuing operations”, which wildly fluctuates from year to year. However, since this account represents an aggregate view of businesses that Nautilus plans to sell but continues to operate until the sell date it makes sense that the account will be more or less profitable depending on the specific contents year to year. 

## Discussion of ROA, PM and ATO and how they have changed
Nautilus Inc.’s return on assets has declined over the past four years due to a combination of decreasing asset turnover and profit margins. Nautilus Inc.’s asset turnover ratios have declined in every year since 2012, driven by larger increases in asset percentages relative to sales growth percentages. A large part of Nautilus Inc.’s asset growth, was in the form of inventory. For 2014 Nautilus Inc.’s inventories increased $9.1 million to $24.9 million, compared to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2013, due to higher revenue, additional products, the opening of a new distribution center, and the west coast port slowdown that caused delayed deliveries by 15-25 days. For 2015 the company’s inventory growth was driven by a large acquisition (Octane Fitness, LLC), higher revenue and the addition of new products.
Except for 2013 Nautilus Inc.’s profit margins have generally trended downward over the past four years. In 2013 the company recorded an income tax benefit of $38.9 million related to the reduction of their existing valuation allowance, which skewed profit margins. Otherwise, Nautilus Inc. has reported profit margins in the 6% - 8% range.
